# ML Driven Financial-Revenue-Dashboard Application 

## Goal

The primary goal of this project is to develop a complete financial revenue application dashboard to tract and visualize impactful Key Performance Indictors (KPIs). In addition, utilize Machine Learning for future revenue predictions. Leveraging the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack, the aim is to create a user-friendly dashboard capable of providing insights into financial data and making predictions using machine learning models.

## Tech Stack

- MongoDB
- Express.js
- React.js
- Node.js
